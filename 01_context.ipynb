    "This presentation largely focuses on one question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### How can we get the most from our geochemical data?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discuss below and in other sections of this presentation, this is partly about asking the right questions, but also how we use, value and enrich our data. In particular, we discuss how we use our data to build and evaluate models of how our planet operates and evolves, and how we can adapt to more modern methods for assessing these in a relatively data-rich age.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time as we're adopting increasingly digital approaches to research and ammassing large collections of data, we're encoutering the growing challenges of sustainabilty extracting the resources used to facilitate the technology. A steady demand for 'tech metals' along with a shift towards renewable energy (and together with it, increasing demand for battery metals) coupled with limited supply (either due to geographical heterogeneity, or simply that many of these metals are produced as by-products of major commodities) renders many of these resources 'critical metals'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure future metal supply, continued exploration for both well known and potentially novel mineral deposits will be required. However, like many sectors, mineral exploration teams are expected to do more with lower budgets. They're also often working in relatively data-poor scenarios (at least relative to the scale they're working at). Below we discuss some of the challenges of questions in exploration, and some approaches which might be useful in 'putting our data to work' to mitigate some of the risk of mineral exploration, potentially reduce time to discoveries, and provide some more certainty for the inputs to critical minerals piplelines.\n"
